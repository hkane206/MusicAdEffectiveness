# MusicAdEffectiveness
This is a project I did for a high school class to practice my machine learning skills. I wanted to see if features about the background music in an advertisement could make an advertisement more effective.

Original dataset was obtained from Hahn & Kovashka (2019), which contained features about video advertisements collected from YouTube and effectiveness ratings (how well advertisers convey their message to viewers) that previous literature collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk. I then added a few new features related to the audio of the ads (see Dataset Creation & Key Analysis).

I experimented with a few different machine learning classifiers to see which ones could predict if an advertisement would be effective or not. I also tried hybridizing all the classifiers I used to see if that improved predictions.

# Why this project?
Playing music has always been an important part of my life, so it was cool to apply ML techniques to an area I was interested in. Definitely room for improvement but in retrospect this project got me excited about continuing to explore computer science!
